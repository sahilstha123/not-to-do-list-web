# Not-To-Do-List (MERN STACK)

A **Not-To-Do-List** application built using the **MERN STACK** (MongoDb, Node.js, Express, React)

This project helps user tasks they should **avoid or focus**, along with the **hours spent** on them.

---

## Project Overview

Unlike a traditional to-do list, the app focuses on identifying **bad habits or unproductive tasks**

### Core Ideas
- Users and tasks with **hours**
- Tasks are categorized into:
    - **Entry List** (default)
    - **Bad List**
- Tasks can be **switched between Lists**
- Both lists are displayed in **seperated tables**
